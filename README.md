### App Requirements

Make a call to the randomuser.me API (or next.json-generator if
randomuser.me is offline) and get 100 users.
Display the following fields for each user:

First name
Last name
Country
Date of birth
Create and display an additional “Birthday” field whose value is
dynamically calculated.

The value should identify if the user’s birthday: a) already happened,
b) is today(!), or c) has yet to occur, based on today’s date for the
current year.
